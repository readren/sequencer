/**
 * A '''Doer''' encloses [[Duty]] and [[Task]] instances, enforcing '''sequential execution''' of tasks and duties.
 * This sequentiality is '''scoped to the duties and tasks enclosed by the same instance of Doer'''. Specifically:
 *  - Duties and tasks created by the same '''Doer''' instance will execute sequentially relative to each other.
 *  - Duties and tasks created by different '''Doer''' instances are '''independent''' and may execute concurrently or in any order.
 *
 * == Execution of Routines ==
 * All routines (functions, procedures, predicates, or by-name parameters) passed to the operations of [[Duty]] and [[Task]]
 * (including callbacks like `onComplete`) are also executed sequentially with respect to the duties and tasks enclosed by
 * the same '''Doer''' instance. This ensures that all operations associated with a single '''Doer''' instance maintain sequential
 * consistency, unless explicitly documented otherwise in the method's documentation.
 *
 * == Key Points ==
 * - Sequential execution is '''instance-specific''': Each '''Doer''' instance manages its own sequence of tasks and duties.
 * - Routines passed to tasks and duties (e.g., callbacks) are executed in the same sequential scope as the enclosing '''Doer''' instance.
 * - Tasks and duties across different '''Doer''' instances are '''independent''' and may run concurrently.
 * ==Note:==
 * At the time of writing, almost all the operations and classes in this source file are thread-safe and may function properly on any kind of execution context. The only exceptions are the classes [[CombinedTask]] and [[Commitment]], which could be enhanced to support concurrency. However, given that a design goal was to allow [[Task]] and the functions their operators receive to close over variables in code sections guaranteed to be executed solely by the DoSiThEx (doer's single-threaded executor), the effort and cost of making them concurrent would be unnecessary.
 * See [[Doer.Assistant.executeSequentially()]].
 *
 * @define DoSiThEx DoSiThEx (doer's single-thread executor)
 * @define onCompleteExecutedByDoSiThEx The `onComplete` callback passed to `engage` is always, with no exception, executed by this $DoSiThEx. This is part of the contract of the [[Task]] trait.
 * @define threadSafe This method is thread-safe.
 * @define isExecutedByDoSiThEx Executed within the DoSiThEx (doer's single-thread executor).
 * @define unhandledErrorsArePropagatedToTaskResult The call to this routine is guarded with try-catch. If it throws a non-fatal exception it will be caught and the [[Task]] will complete with a [[Failure]] containing the error.
 * @define unhandledErrorsAreReported The call to this routine is guarded with a try-catch. If the evaluation throws a non-fatal exception it will be caught and reported with [[Doer.Assistant.reportFailure()]].
 * @define notGuarded CAUTION: The call to this function is NOT guarded with a try-catch. If its evaluation terminates abruptly the duty will never complete. The same occurs with all routines received by [[Duty]] operations. This is one of the main differences with [[Task]] operation.
 * @define maxRecursionDepthPerExecutor Maximum recursion depth per executor. Once this limit is reached, the recursion continues in a new executor. The result does not depend on this parameter as long as no [[java.lang.StackOverflowError]] occurs.
 * @define isWithinDoSiThEx indicates whether the caller is certain that this method is being executed within the $DoSiThEx. If there is no such certainty, the caller should set this parameter to `false` (or don't specify a value). This flag is useful for those [[Task]]s whose first action can or must be executed in the DoSiThEx, as it informs them that they can immediately execute said action synchronously. This method is thread-safe when this parameter value is false.

	/////////////// DUTY ///////////////

	abstract class AbstractDuty[+A] extends Duty[A]


	/**
	 * Encapsulates one or more chained actions and provides operations to declaratively build complex duties from simpler ones.
	 * This tool eliminates the need for state variables that determine the decision-making flow, as the code structure itself indicates the execution order.
	 *
	 * This tool was created to simplify the implementation of an actor that needs to perform multiple duties simultaneously (as opposed to a finite state machine), because the overhead of separating them into different actors would be significant.
	 *
	 * Instances of [[Duty]] whose result is always the same follow the monadic laws. However, if the result depends on mutable variables or timing, these laws may be broken.
	 * For example, if a duty `d` closes over a mutable variable from the environment that affects its execution result, the equality of two supposedly equivalent expressions like {{{t.flatMap(f).flatMap(g) == t.flatMap(a => f(a).flatMap(g))}}} could be compromised. This would depend on the timing of when the variable is mutatedâ€”specifically if the mutation occurs between the start and end of execution.
	 * This does not mean that [[Duty]] implementations (and the routines their operations receive) must avoid closing over mutable variables altogether. Rather, it highlights that if strict adherence to monadic laws is required by your business logic, you should ensure that the mutable variable is not modified during task execution.
	 * For deterministic behavior, it's sufficient that any closed-over mutable variable is only mutated and accessed by actions executed in sequence. This is why the contract centralizes execution in the $DoSiThEx: to maintain determinism, even when closing over mutable variables, provided they are mutated and accessed solely within the $DoSiThEx.
	 *
	 * Design note: [[Duty]] is a member of [[Doer]] to ensure that access to [[Duty]] instances is restricted to the section of code where the owning [[Doer]] is exposed.
	 *
	 * CAUTION: Unlike [[Task]], [[Duty]] does NOT support failures. And unlike [[Task]], the call to routines received by its operations is not guarded with a try-catch. Therefore, unlike [[Task]], any unhandled exception thrown during the execution of a [[Duty]] will break the expected flow and the duty will never complete.
	 * It is recommended to use [[Task]] instead of [[Duty]] unless efficiency is a concern.
	 *
	 * @tparam A the type of result obtained when executing this duty.

		 * [[Duty]], on the other hand, assumes that these routines never throw exceptions. If an exception is thrown, the stack of the corresponding task will be completely unwound.
